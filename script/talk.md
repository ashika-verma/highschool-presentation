# Talk Script
**Audience:** High school women interested in coding
**Format:** 20 minutes over Zoom — students are together in one classroom in Texas, presenter is in NYC
**Vibe:** Honest, fun, human. Not a TED talk. Not a recruiting pitch.

---

## Before You Start

- Coordinator puts up QR code while students settle
- Students scan → animated lobby → enter name → pick a color → app background shifts to their color
- You're watching the dashboard in NYC, seeing names populate
- When you're ready to start, enable color control mode
- Your lights will already be slowly shifting as the lobby does its thing

---

## 0:00 — The Opening

*You appear on Zoom. Lights are shifting behind you. Don't explain it yet.*

> "Okay — I see some of you have already found the app. Go ahead, pick whatever color you want."

*Wait ~10 seconds. Watch your room go chaotic. Let them react to each other.*

> "I've always had a complicated relationship with light switches."

*Let that land weird. Then:*

> "When I was in high school — actually your school — I was lying in bed one summer and I did not want to get up to turn off the lights. The switch was all the way across the room. So I spent the next three hours building a machine out of cardboard and tape that would let me flip it from my bed."
>
> "It didn't work great. But it kind of worked. And I was so proud of it."
>
> "That's basically my whole career. I see something annoying, I refuse to accept it, and I build something. Usually ridiculous. Sometimes useful."
>
> "My name is [Name]. I went to school where you're sitting, I ended up at MIT, and now I'm in New York working on software in the AI space. And what you're doing to my apartment right now is a much cleaner version of that cardboard machine."

## 2:00 — Your Story

*Told as a theme, not a resume. Two or three moments, not a timeline.*

> "I worked hard in school. I cared about my grades. I stressed about applications. But if I'm being honest, the things that shaped me most weren't things I did for a grade."

> "In chem class, we had to do these combustion reactions — balancing chemical equations. Incredibly tedious. And I thought: why am I doing this by hand when I could just... not. So I programmed a checker into my calculator that gave me the answer and showed every single step."
>
> "Was that cheating? I think about that sometimes. I prefer to call it: understanding the problem well enough to automate it."

*[brief laugh, then:]*

> "My senior year, my friend convinced the tech guy to let him deploy a script on every computer in the school. On prank day, every computer started reading everything on the screen out loud. And randomly opening and closing the CD drives."
>
> "The chaos was incredible. I was an innocent bystander. I watched the whole thing. Ten out of ten."

*[beat]*

> "I also built a grade calculator so I always knew exactly what I needed on the next test. I built an app that just cycled through the worst photos of my friends. I competed in robotics, 3D printing, quiz bowl. Played violin in the school musical. Sang at a showcase."
>
> "None of these things connected on a resume. But they all connected in my head — because every one of them was: here's something I'm curious about, here are people I want to do it with, let's see what happens."

*[Slide on phones: fun collage of these stories — calculator, cardboard machine, etc.]*

## 5:30 — The Flow State Moment

*This is the thing to land before MIT.*

> "Here's something I noticed about myself. The projects I worked on because I had to — I did the minimum. Got it done, moved on."
>
> "The projects I worked on because I wanted to — I worked on for eight hours and didn't notice time passing. And I got genuinely good at them in a way I didn't with the other stuff."
>
> "That's not unique to me. That's how humans work. When you actually enjoy something, you go deeper, you push further, you figure out the hard parts because you want to, not because you have to. And that depth shows up. In your work, in interviews, in what you can actually build."
>
> "The trick is figuring out what flips that switch for you. And then trusting it enough to actually follow it."

---

## 7:00 — MIT (the intimidation is real)

> "I ended up at MIT for electrical engineering and computer science. And I want to be honest about what that felt like."
>
> "Everyone around me had been training for this their whole lives. Kids who'd been doing competitive math since they were eight. Kids with research papers. Kids who had clearly identified their life's purpose at fourteen and had been executing on it ever since."
>
> "And I was like... I balanced chemical equations on my calculator. I built a cardboard light switch machine. I made an app of bad photos of my friends."
>
> "I genuinely thought I'd made a mistake for about a semester."

*[let that breathe]*

> "And then I found my people. Who were the same kind of people I'd always been: builders who wanted to make things and have fun doing it."
>
> "In my security class, my professor basically gave us an assignment to break into something real. So my team hacked into the intro programming class. We could see and edit anyone's grades. We reported it, nobody's GPA was harmed, we got an A."
>
> "My dorm built a two-story escape room. I did the costume design. I released an album with my music group. I learned to beatbox. I built an LED theremin — that's an instrument you play without touching it. I rebuilt Guitar Hero from scratch. I made a marble out of glass in the glass lab."

*[Slide on phones: MIT energy — escape room, theremin, album art]*

> "I have friends from MIT who are now at DeepMind working on AI most people can't understand yet. A friend doing quantum computing. Absolute geniuses who will go incredibly deep in their fields."
>
> "For a while I compared myself to them and felt like I was falling short. It took me a while to realize that's the wrong game. My thing was never being the deepest expert in one thing. It was being curious enough about everything that I could build things that crossed between fields. And that turned out to be useful in its own way."

## 11:00 — What This Means For You

> "Here's what I want you to take from all of that."
>
> "Every field you care about has problems sitting in it — problems the people inside the field are too close to see clearly. Problems that need someone who understands both the people and the systems."

*[Slide on phones: one image per domain, big and visual]*

> **Bio:** "Teams using machine learning to catch cancer earlier than any doctor could spot it. Someone had to understand both the biology and the code."
>
> **Fashion:** "Designers prototyping hundreds of garments in the time it used to take to make one. Someone who understood both aesthetics and algorithms."
>
> **Space:** "Every SpaceX launch coordinated by software written by people who cared about orbital mechanics, manufacturing, and real-time decisions when something goes wrong."
>
> **Teaching:** "Tutoring systems that can tell when a student is confused before they even realize it — from how long they pause before answering. Someone who cared about learning, not just code."

> "What do you care about outside of technology? Because that thing needs someone who can also build."

## 13:00 — The Live Demo

> "I want to build something. Right now. For you."
>
> "Give me an idea — anything. Put it in the app chat."

*Read a few. Pick one that's fun or slightly unexpected. Type the prompt into Claude Code live.*

> "Okay. Watch this."

*Let it run visibly. Narrate casually — "it's writing actual files right now... look, it just built the whole layout." Don't oversell it. Let the weirdness of it speak.*

> "Here's what I want you to notice. That took me 30 seconds to start. But I had to know what to ask for. I have to know if what it built actually works. I have to know what to do with it next."
>
> "AI is like having a very fast, very literal assistant who does exactly what you say and nothing more. You still have to know what to say. You still have to know if it's right. That's not nothing — that's actually the whole job."

## 16:00 — Give Them Control Again

*Switch app to tug-of-war mode. Split the room.*

> "Alright. Left side of the room, you're picking one color. Right side, you pick yours. I want to see who actually runs this classroom."

*60-90 seconds of chaos. Your room shifts back and forth. Have fun with it.*

> "This is also software. Someone wrote the rules for how this works — what happens when more people vote one way, how fast it shifts. That someone could be you."

---

## 18:00 — The Close

*Calm. Direct. No slides for this part — just you on screen.*

> "I'm not going to tell you that coding will get you into a good school or guarantee you a specific job. I don't know what the world looks like in ten years, and anyone who tells you they do is guessing."
>
> "What I do know is this: the most interesting problems live at the edges of things. Between biology and software. Between people and systems. Between what exists and what's clearly missing but nobody's built yet."
>
> "And the skill that lets you work at those edges is learning to think in systems. To see how parts connect. What breaks. What can be automated, what can't. What the actual problem is underneath the one everyone's trying to solve."
>
> "Coding is one of the best ways to develop that skill — not because you'll write code forever, but because it forces you to be precise about how things work. You can't be fuzzy about logic when a computer is involved. And that clarity transfers to everything: how you understand an organization, how you see a problem, how you think about people."
>
> "The people who'll shape the next twenty years aren't necessarily the deepest experts in one thing. They're the ones who can move between worlds, see the connections, and actually build something at the intersection."
>
> "You don't have to know what you want to build yet. You just have to stay curious. Keep making things — even if they're ridiculous, even if they're just for you, even if they're just to see if it works."

*[beat]*

> "You turned my lights pink from Texas. That's a pretty good start."
