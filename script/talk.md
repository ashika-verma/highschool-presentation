# Talk Script

**Audience:** High school women interested in coding (Girls Who Code)
**Format:** 20 minutes over Zoom — students are together in one classroom in Texas, presenter is in NYC
**Vibe:** Honest, fun, human. Not a TED talk. Not a recruiting pitch.
**Through-line:** Make your own space. With whatever you've got.

---

## Before You Start

- Coordinator puts up QR code while students settle
- Students scan → pixel art lobby → enter name → pick a color → app background dithers to their color
- You're watching the host dashboard in NYC, seeing pixel people pop in as names arrive
- When you're ready to start, tap "Color Control" on host dashboard
- Your lights will already be slowly shifting as the lobby does its thing

---

## 0:00 — The Opening

_You appear on Zoom. Two lights are shifting behind you. Don't explain it yet._

> "Okay — I see some of you have already found the app. Go ahead, pick whatever color you want."

_Wait ~10 seconds. Your room goes chaotic. Let them react to each other._

> "I've always had a complicated relationship with light switches."

_Let that land weird. Then:_

> "When I was your age — actually at your school — I was lying in bed one summer and I did not want to get up to turn off the lights. The switch was all the way across the room. So I went to the garage, grabbed cardboard, tape, a cassette player, a clip, some string, and a ball — and spent the next three hours building a machine where rolling the ball down a ramp would flip the switch from my bed."
>
> "It was clunky. I had to reset it every time I walked in. But it worked. And I was genuinely proud of it."
>
> "That's basically my whole life. I see something that doesn't have a place for me, I refuse to accept it, and I build my own version. Usually ridiculous. Sometimes useful."
>
> "My name is Ashika. I went to CSHS, then MIT, and now I'm in New York. And what y'all are doing to my apartment right now is a much cleaner version of that cardboard machine."

## 2:00 — Your Story

_Not a resume. The real thread._

> "This starts in middle school. I took robotics. I really wanted to be the one who programmed the robot — I wanted to look like that cool edgy hacker-type woman I'd see on TV. What I didn't know: so did every other kid in the class. Twenty other guys, all fighting for time on the one computer."
>
> "And I was the only girl."

_[beat — Bulb B turns off]_

> "I could have bent myself into a shape that fit. I didn't. I was bummed for a while. But eventually I thought: this space isn't making room for me. So what can I actually get my hands on?"
>
> "The answer was the TI-84. Those were everywhere — every classroom, always in my backpack. I taught myself from YouTube. And the first thing I built was a prank."
>
> "If you typed in a calculation, it'd give you an answer that was... almost right. Randomly off by somewhere between negative five and positive five. Just enough to make you second-guess yourself."

_[beat — let them react. App: emoji reaction bar activates for first time]_

> "I showed it to my friend Ben. He was impressed — so he built something to impress me back. So I built something else. We started getting into each other's calculators and writing programs to trip each other up. It kept escalating. Eventually we each had to build a lock screen just so the other one couldn't get in."

_[beat]_

> "Here's the thing about that: neither of us was trying to learn to code. We were trying to impress each other. And we lost hours to it without noticing. That's the tell. When you're actually hooked — when you care — time disappears. And you get genuinely good in a way you never do when you're just checking a box."
>
> "The trick is figuring out what hooks you. And then trusting it enough to actually follow it."

_[beat]_

> "Once I knew how to program, I started seeing problems differently. Chemistry class: balance combustion equations by hand. Incredibly tedious. I thought — I could just... not. So I built a checker that gave me the answer and showed every step."
>
> "Was that cheating? I've thought about it. I prefer: understanding a problem well enough to automate it."

_[brief laugh]_

> "This kept going all the way to senior year. By then I'd been doing violin, 3D modeling, robotics, all of it separately — and for SkillsUSA, I pulled it all into one thing. Built a VR escape room. Designed the world, wrote the code, built the 3D assets, did the sound. Everything I'd been doing for years in separate tabs, open at once. When people played it, they had no idea it came from one person."
>
> "I didn't know I could do that until I did it."

## 6:30 — Being the Only Woman in the Room

_Specific. High school only. Not a victim story — but don't rush the honest part._

> "That pattern of making my own space kept showing up because I kept running into rooms that didn't have one for me."
>
> "I started a UIL programming club. Every meeting — just guys. Every time."
>
> "Then we went to nationals. I walked up to check in. The proctor looked down at his clipboard — didn't even glance up at me — and said: 'Please set up and take a seat in the room, sir.'"
>
> "I walked in. And I started counting the women."
>
> "Four. Total. All of them in the college division. I was the only high schooler."

_[beat — sit in it]_

> "And I want to be real with you: that's frustrating. It was frustrating then and it would be frustrating now. You're allowed to find it frustrating."

_[beat]_

> "But here's also what's true: when you're the person who notices what's missing, you see things other people don't. You ask questions nobody else thought to ask because they're too used to how things already work. That awareness — of gaps, of who's not in the room, of what hasn't been built yet — is a skill. And once you've built it, you can't turn it off."
>
> "I stopped thinking of it as a disadvantage a long time ago."

---

## 8:00 — MIT

> "I ended up at MIT for electrical engineering and computer science. And I want to be honest about what walking in felt like."
>
> "There were kids who'd been doing competitive math since they were eight. Kids who'd already published research. And I was like — I have no idea what this math competition even is. I just like making things for my friends."

_[beat]_

> "But MIT was different from those competition rooms. I wasn't doing a scan when I walked in. I wasn't counting. I just felt like I belonged. Everyone wanted to make something. You'd bump into someone at 2am who'd just figured out something wild, and they'd spend an hour explaining it to you just because they were excited. I learned more from those hallway conversations than from half my classes."

_[App: MIT photo collage pushes to phones]_

> "One assignment in my security class: my professor basically said go break into something real. So my team hacked into the intro programming class. We could see and edit anyone's grades. We reported it immediately. Nobody's GPA was harmed. We got an A."

_[let them react]_

> "My thing in college was never being the deepest expert in one thing. It was staying curious across everything — code, music, design, hardware — and finding where they connect. Because that's where the interesting problems live. Not inside one field. At the edges."

---

## 10:30 — The Side Quests

> "I started a YouTube channel after college. Got to 3,000 subscribers. Then killed it."

_[beat]_

> "On purpose. The numbers were going up but I was dreading hitting record. That's the opposite of the Ben thing — that's the tell in the other direction. When you're dreading the thing, that's information. So I stopped. No regrets."
>
> "Knowing when to kill something is as important as knowing how to start it."

_[App: quick push — binary choice: "Have you ever quit something on purpose?" YES / NOT YET / CURRENTLY DECIDING]_

_[beat]_

> "I built an instrument. Took apart a vape — looked at the battery, the pressure sensor, the part that reads how hard you inhale — and thought: I can use this. Wired it up. Blew into it. It played a note. Now I have an instrument I made and I write songs on it."

_[beat]_

> "Same instinct as the TI-84. Same instinct as the cardboard machine. Find something. Figure out what it does. Make it do something else."

_[beat]_

> "I spent some time after MIT at a big trading firm — got to see how money moves at scale, built systems where the timing has to be exact down to microseconds. Interesting engineering. Not my calling. The side projects were always what I came home to."
>
> "In a month I'm starting at an AI startup — matching sponsors with creators, figuring out which brand should work with which YouTuber, at scale. Systems and people. Same thing I've always been drawn to."

## 12:30 — Open Question

_[App: switches to free-text input. Responses scroll live on everyone's phones — students can read each other's answers.]_

> "Before I show you how this thing works — I want to know what you're actually into. Not tech. What do you love? Type it in or just shout it."

_[Read what comes in. React out loud. Make the connection for whatever they say. Don't script this — just listen.]_

_[After ~30 seconds:]_

> "Every single thing in this room has a version of its problem that needs someone who can build. Your interests aren't a distraction from tech. They're the reason you'll be better at it than someone who only knows the code."

_[Pick a color on the spot based on the vibe of what they said. Tap it. Lights shift.]_

---

## 14:00 — The Demo

> "Now look at the app on your phone."
>
> "You've been using this for the last fourteen minutes. You changed the color of my room in New York. You just told me what you love and the lights shifted."
>
> "I built this. This week."

_[App: demo reveal — white flash, then the total color change counter appears large in pixel font]_

_[Screen share: open the server code. Point to two things max.]_

> "This is the part that talks to the lights. When you tap a color on your phone, it sends a tiny message — called a WebSocket — to a server running on my laptop right now. The server reads it and commands the bulbs over my wifi. That round trip: about 50 milliseconds. The time it takes to blink."

_[Close the code.]_

> "That's the whole trick. Software isn't complicated — it's just very precise. You tell it exactly what to do, in exactly the right order, and it does it every time without complaining. That precision is the skill. Once you have it, you can build anything."

_[beat]_

> "Including this. I'm not a professional speaker — I don't do this for a living. But I know how to build things. So I built a presentation instead of making a PowerPoint. The interactive app, the lights, the live demo — none of that is a speaker skill. It's a build skill. And a build skill is learnable."

---

## 16:00 — The Close

_Calm. Just you on screen. Lights already in a slow fade toward pink._

> "I want to tell you something about why I'm actually here."
>
> "When I was sitting where you're sitting — in that school, in those hallways — there was no Girls Who Code. No club. No older woman who came back and said 'I did this and you can too.' There was just me, a TI-84, and a robotics class full of guys who weren't trying to be mean — they just didn't think to make room."
>
> "So I made my own. Every time."

_[beat]_

> "You don't have to do that. You are sitting in a room full of people who are here for the same reason you are. That is not nothing — that is actually everything. The thing that made Ben and me both better wasn't a class. It was having someone right there who pushed us. You have a whole room of that right now."

_[beat]_

> "Make your own space. In whatever room you walk into. With whatever you've got."

_[small pause — let a smile land]_

> "You turned my lights pink from Texas. That's a pretty good start."

_[App: send-off screen — "Make something. Show someone. Keep going."]_
