# Talk Script

**Audience:** High school women interested in coding
**Format:** 20 minutes over Zoom — students are together in one classroom in Texas, presenter is in NYC
**Vibe:** Honest, fun, human. Not a TED talk. Not a recruiting pitch.

---

## Before You Start

- Coordinator puts up QR code while students settle
- Students scan → animated lobby → enter name → pick a color → app background shifts to their color
- You're watching the dashboard in NYC, seeing names populate
- When you're ready to start, enable color control mode
- Your lights will already be slowly shifting as the lobby does its thing

---

## 0:00 — The Opening

_You appear on Zoom. Lights are shifting behind you. Don't explain it yet._

> "Okay — I see some of you have already found the app. Go ahead, pick whatever color you want."

_Wait ~10 seconds. Watch your room go chaotic. Let them react to each other._

> "I've always had a complicated relationship with light switches."

_Let that land weird. Then:_

> "When I was in high school — actually your school — I was lying in bed one summer and I did not want to get up to turn off the lights. The switch was all the way across the room. So I spent the next three hours building a machine out of cardboard and tape that would let me flip it from my bed."
>
> "It was a little clumsy & I had to reset it every time I walked in my room. But it worked. And I was really proud of it."
>
> "That's basically been my whole life. I see something annoying, I refuse to accept it, and I build something. Usually ridiculous. Sometimes useful."
>
> "My name is Ashika. I went to CSHS (my high school), I ended up at MIT, and now I'm in New York working on software in the AI space. And what y'all are doing to my apartment right now is a much cleaner version of that cardboard machine."

## 2:00 — Your Story

_Told as a theme, not a resume. The origin story first, then where it led._

> "I worked hard in high school. Much like y'all probably, I cared about my grades. I stressed about college applications and summer programs and my exact rank. But if I'm being honest, the things that shaped me most were never the things I did for a grade."

> "It actually starts in way back in middle school for me, which should be 2013. I took robotics, and I really wanted to be the one who programmed the robot. I wanted look like that cool edgy hacker type woman I'd see on TV. Little did I know that so did every other kid in the class — twenty other guys, all fighting for time on the one computer."
>
> "And I was the only girl."

_[let that land]_

> "I could have fought for that spot and inserted myself into that group of boys by bending my personality, but I didn't and I was really bummed out for a while. But eventually I looked around and thought: this space isn't really making room for me. So what can I actually get my hands on? And the answer was the TI-84. Those were free reign, they were in a bunch of classrooms and I had my own in always on me in my backpack."
>
> "So I made my own space. And I taught myself with YouTube. And the first thing I built was a prank. If you typed in a small calculation, it'd give you an answer that was... almost right. Randomly off by somewhere between -5 and 5. Just enough to make you second-guess yourself."

_[beat, let them laugh]_

> "I ran this prank on my friend Ben to show off. He though it was awesome, so he tried to out-prank me back. So I added a password to my calculator. He added a password to his. We kept escalating — more sophisticated locks, more elaborate pranks — until we'd each basically built our own little operating systems on these things just to mess with each other."
>
> "Neither of us was trying to learn to code. We were trying to win. But somewhere in there, we both actually got pretty good at it."

_[beat]_

> "And once I knew how to program the calculator, I started seeing problems differently. In chem class, we had to balance these combustion equations by hand — incredibly tedious. And I thought: I could just... not. So I built a checker that gave me the answer and showed every step."
>
> "Was that cheating? I've thought about it. I prefer: understanding the problem well enough to automate it."

_[brief laugh]_

> "From there this skill learning & application process kept going. I built a grade calculator so I always knew exactly what I needed on the next test. An app that cycled through the worst photos of my friends. I competed in robotics — this time actually getting to program — and 3D printing and quiz bowl. Played violin in the school musical. Sang at a showcase. And senior year, I built a full VR escape room for a national competition called SkillsUSA."
>
> "And that pattern of making my own space kept showing up. In a lot of these rooms, I was one of very few women, sometimes the only one. You get used to walking in and doing a quick scan. You learn to find the other people who are a little outside the main group too, and you build with them instead."
>
> "None of these things connected on a resume. But they all connected in my head — because every one of them was: here's something I'm curious about, here are people I want to do it with, let's see what happens."

_[Slide on phones: fun collage — calculator, cardboard machine, robotics, etc.]_

## 5:30 — The Flow State Moment

_This is the thing to land before MIT._

> "Here's something I noticed about myself. The projects I worked on because I had to — I did the minimum. Got it done, moved on."
>
> "The projects I worked on because I wanted to — I worked on for eight hours and didn't notice time passing. And I got genuinely good at them in a way I didn't with the other stuff."
>
> "That's not unique to me. That's how humans work. When you actually enjoy something, you go deeper, you push further, you figure out the hard parts because you want to, not because you have to. And that depth shows up. In your work, in interviews, in what you can actually build."
>
> "The trick is figuring out what flips that switch for you. And then trusting it enough to actually follow it."

---

## 7:00 — MIT

> "I ended up at MIT for electrical engineering and computer science. And I want to be honest about what walking in felt like."
>
> "There were kids who'd been doing competitive math since they were eight. Kids who'd had a research paper published. Kids who felt like physics was their passion since age twelve and had been executing on that ever since."
>
> "And I was like... I balanced chemical equations on my calculator. I built a cardboard light switch machine. I made an app of bad photos of my friends."

_[beat]_

> "But here's the thing — I never once thought I'd made a mistake going there. If anything, I thought it was exactly the right place for me. Because underneath all that intensity, everyone was a builder. Everyone wanted to make something. The spirit was genuinely supportive. People were excited to share what they knew."
>
> "I learned more from random hallway conversations than I did from half my classes. You'd bump into someone at 2am who just figured out something wild and they'd spend an hour explaining it to you. That's MIT."

_[beat]_

> "One thing I didn't expect: MIT forces everyone to code. Bio majors. Music majors. Physics majors. Every single student has to take programming. And that's not an accident — they know something. They know that whatever field you go into, being able to think computationally changes what you can do in it."
>
> "In my security class, my professor basically gave us an assignment to break into something real. So my team hacked into the intro programming class. We could see and edit anyone's grades. We reported it, nobody's GPA was harmed, we got an A."
>
> "My dorm built a two-story escape room. I did the costume design. I released an album with my music group. I learned to beatbox. I built an LED theremin — an instrument you play without touching it. I rebuilt Guitar Hero from scratch. I made a marble out of glass."

_[Slide on phones: MIT energy — escape room, theremin, album art]_

> "I have friends from MIT now at DeepMind working on AI that most people can't understand yet. A friend doing quantum computing. Absolute geniuses who will go incredibly deep in their fields. Being around people like that doesn't make you feel small — it makes you learn faster than you ever thought possible. You just absorb it."
>
> "My thing was never being the deepest expert in one thing. It was being curious enough about everything that I could build across fields. That turned out to be its own kind of useful."

---

## 11:00 — What This Means For You (+ The Poll)

> "Here's what I want you to take from all of that."
>
> "Every field you care about has problems sitting in it — problems the people inside are too close to see clearly. Problems that need someone who understands both the people and the systems."
>
> "Before I tell you about those fields — I want to know which one you actually care about."

_[Switch app to poll mode. Four options appear on their phones with colors:]_
_🟢 Health & Bio · 🟣 Fashion & Design · 🔵 Space & Environment · 🟡 People & Education_

> "Vote now. Lights go to whatever wins."

_[Wait ~20 seconds. Lights shift to the winning color. React to the result genuinely — whatever they picked, lean into it.]_

> "Okay — [winning field]. Let me tell you what's actually happening there."

_[Lead with the winning field, then cover the others more briefly. Talking points for each:]_

> **Health & Bio:** "There are teams using machine learning to catch cancer in scans earlier than any doctor could spot it. The people building those tools had to understand both the biology and the code. Neither alone was enough."
>
> **Fashion & Design:** "Designers are prototyping hundreds of garments in the time it used to take to make one. Generative tools are reshaping the whole creative process — but someone who only knows code and not aesthetics can't build something that actually works for designers."
>
> **Space & Environment:** "Every SpaceX launch is coordinated by software written by people who cared deeply about physics, manufacturing, and how to make real-time decisions when something goes wrong at 30,000 feet."
>
> **People & Education:** "There are tutoring systems now that can tell when a student is confused before the student even realizes it — just from how long they pause before answering. Someone who cared about learning, not just algorithms, built that."

> "Whatever you voted for — that thing needs people who can build. Your interests aren't a distraction from tech. They're your edge."

## 13:30 — The Demo (It's Already In Your Hands)

> "I want to show you something. Look at the app on your phone."
>
> "You've been using this for the last fifteen minutes. You used it to change the color of my room in New York. You just voted in a live poll that moved real lights."
>
> "I built this. This week. Let me show you what's actually happening."

_[Screen share: pull up the server code. Keep it brief — point to two things max.]_

> "This is the part that talks to the lights. When you tap a color on your phone, it sends a tiny message — called a WebSocket — to a server running on my laptop. The server reads that message and sends a command to the light bulbs over my wifi. Start to finish, that round trip takes about 50 milliseconds."
>
> "That's it. That's the whole magic trick. A message travels from your phone in Texas to a bulb in my ceiling in New York in the time it takes you to blink."

_[Close the code.]_

> "Software isn't complicated. It's just very precise. You have to tell it exactly what to do, in exactly the right order, and it will do it — every time, without complaining. That precision is the skill. And once you have it, you can use it to build anything."

---

## 18:00 — The Close

_Calm. Direct. No slides for this part — just you on screen._

> "I want to tell you something about why I'm actually here."
>
> "When I was sitting where you're sitting — in that school, in those hallways — there was no Girls Who Code. There was no club. There was no older woman who came back and said 'hey, I did this and you can too.'"
>
> "There was just me, a TI-84, and a robotics class full of guys who weren't trying to be mean — they just didn't think to make room. So I made my own."
>
> "I had to figure a lot of it out alone."

_[beat]_

> "You don't have to do that. You are sitting in a room full of people who are here for the same reason you are. That is not nothing. That is actually everything. The thing that made Ben and me both better programmers wasn't a class — it was having someone next to us who pushed us. You have a whole room of that."
>
> "I'm the OG girl who coded at this school. You're what comes next. And what comes next has a running start."

_[brief pause, then shift tone slightly]_

> "Here's the one idea I want you to take with you: the most interesting problems in the world live at the edges — between biology and software, between people and systems, between what exists and what's clearly missing. And the people who get to work on those problems are the ones who learned to think across lines. To understand how things connect. To be precise about how systems work, whether those systems are code, or organizations, or people."
>
> "Coding is one of the best ways to build that muscle. Not because you'll write code forever — but because you can't be fuzzy about logic when a computer is involved. And that clarity transfers to everything."
>
> "You don't have to know what you want to build yet. You just have to stay curious. Keep making things — even if they're ridiculous, even if they're just for you, even if they're just to see if it works."
>
> "And keep making them together."

_[beat]_

> "You turned my lights pink from Texas. That's a pretty good start."
